# Payday2-Overdrill-Stealth
2 Payday 2 mods on First World Bank Overdrill stealth.
1st one will close the vent after one bag has been secured
2nd one will not close the vent

The first one is the ultimate test of skills. Sneaking through the bank with 84 bags of loot is the ultimate stealth challange.
The second one is annoying, but easy. Almost 11milion of spending cash afterwards. I do not reccomend playing this one, but some people wanted it.

The mod was originally made by Dr_Newbie. I just enabled it in online play. And removed the vent in the second version. Enjoy.
